### lightroom
It was created for downloading and buying presets for photos.Web-site uses ***flask***. 
It includes these subpages:
* main page(where you can find information about presets and try them free)
* presets page(where you can download presets)
* instructions page(where you can find instructions for phone and computer)

It has comparing blocks created with plugin ***TwentyTwenty*** and galleries(on my own) created with javascript. 

If you have problems with comparing blocks loading, try CTRL+R, it must help to solve this problem.

There are some examples:
